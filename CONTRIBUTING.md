# Contributing to Forecats

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `master`.
2. **Make your changes** with a descriptive commit messages.
3. **Test your changes** to make sure nothing is broken.
4. **Submit a pull request** with a description of your changes.

## Testing

There are no unit tests atm. You are welcome to contribute some if you want (preferrably using pytest). Otherwise, you can locally test that everything still works fine with

```bash
    cd local_testing && uv run test.py
```

Note that this requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Please try running it on an HA server before submitting the PR.

## Guidelines

- If you change the automation template, make sure these changes are reflected in `models.py` and `local_testing/test.py` as well.
